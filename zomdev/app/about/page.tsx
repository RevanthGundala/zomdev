                Zomdev is a platform that makes it easy for developers to find
                work and for companies to find developers.
                <br />
                <br />
                Hereâ€™s how it works: Companies post a bounty and developers
                complete the task. The developer receives a monetary reward for
                their work, but more importantly, companies gain direct evidence
                of how this person might contribute to their team.
                <br />
                <br />
                We currently only support crypto for paying out bounties, please
                contact us if you have any questions.
